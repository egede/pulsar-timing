# pulsar-timing

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Installation
To setup the working environment, you can use a virtual environment in the following way:

```bash
python3 -m venv pulsar-timing
cd pulsar-timing/
. bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
python -m pip install -e git+ssh://git@github.com/egede/pulsar-timing.git#egg=pulsar-timing
```

## Usage
The Jupyter notebook `fit.ipynb` is illustrating the use.
